## Backend

### M1 - Foundation & Infrastructure
- Done: JPA entities, base repositories, core services, security infrastructure, Flyway V1, HikariCP configuration, and test-isolated `BackendApplication` beans.
- Done: M1 tests: `BackendApplicationTests`, `JWTServiceTest`, `AuditLogServiceTest`, `TenantScopeServiceTest`.

### M2 - Auth & User Provisioning
- Done: `AuthController` - login/logout.
- Done: `InvitationController` - create, validate, accept, resend.
- Done: `PasswordController` - forgot/reset password.
- Done: `UserController` - `GET /api/v1/me`, `GET /api/v1/users?institutionId=`, `GET /api/v1/users/counts?institutionId=`.
- Done: `AuthService`, `AccountLockoutService`, `InvitationService`, `PasswordService`, `UserService`, `UserDto`, `JwtUserDetails`, `TokenHashUtils`, `GlobalExceptionHandler`.
- Done: M2 tests: account lockout, auth, invitations, password, and controller coverage.

### M4 - Institution Management & Scheduling
- Done: `InstitutionController`, `InstitutionService`, `InstitutionRepository`.
- Done: canonical `GET/POST /api/v1/institutions`; legacy `/api/v1/admin/institutions` remains supported.
- Done: `GuardRailService`, `SlotReservationService`, repositories, workspace provisioning, stale draft release job, DTOs, exceptions.
- Done: `Institution.emailDomain` and `V2__add_institution_email_domain.sql`.
- Done: M4 tests: institution DTO/service, guard rails, slot reservations.

### UC-1.3 - Content Submission Backend
- Done: Flyway V3 migration for `media_assets`, `asset_tags`, `submission_media_assets`, RLS, and pgvector index.
- Done: `MediaFileType`, `MediaAsset`, `SubmissionMediaAsset`.
- Done: `MediaAssetRepository`, `SubmissionMediaAssetRepository`, `SubmissionRepository` additions, `UserRepository` additions.
- Done: DTOs for create/update/response/summary/lookups/slot evaluation/media attachment.
- Done: `SubmissionService` - create draft, update, delete, submit, evaluate slot, list, attach uploaded media, attach media asset.
- Done: `SubmissionController` - endpoints on `/api/v1/submissions`.
- Done: required tests before merge:
  - `SubmissionServiceTest`
  - `SubmissionControllerTest`
  - `UserServiceTest`
  - `UserControllerTest`
- Deferred: `POST /api/v1/submissions/{id}/override-request`; implement in Module 3 with override request migration/service.

### Backend Verification
- Done: backend test suite passed with 163 tests.
- Note: `.\mvnw.cmd` fails in the current PowerShell environment; direct Maven from `.m2/wrapper/dists` was used successfully.

### Pending - Backend
- Not Started: UC-2.1 Content Validation - review queue, approve/reject/needs-revision transitions.
- Not Started: UC-2.2 Media Repository - `MediaAssetController`, `GET/DELETE /api/v1/media-assets`.
- Not Started: UC-2.3 Notifications - SSE endpoint, notification service, emitter registry.
- Not Started: UC-2.4 Analytics Dashboard - aggregate endpoints.
- Not Started: UC-3.1 Calendar & Auto-publish - scheduler and Facebook Graph API integration.
- Not Started: UC-3.2 AI Caption - Claude Vision client and async generation.
- Not Started: UC-3.3 AI Classification & Recommendation - Voyage AI client and embedding pipeline.
- Not Started: UC-3.4 Manual Publishing Fallback.
- Not Started: UC-3.5 Admin Exception Handling / Override Request.

## Frontend

### UC-1.1 / UC-1.2 Auth & Onboarding
- Done: login/logout UI wired to auth endpoints.
- Done: invitation accept flow.
- Done: forgot password request flow.
- Done: reset password page wired to `POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password`.
- Done: session banner/modal infrastructure now uses JWT `exp` for countdown and expiry.
- Done: dashboard supports administrator, validator, and contributor views.
- Done: institution provisioning modal wired to canonical `/api/v1/institutions`.
- Done: invite users modal wired to invitation endpoints.

### UC-1.3 Submission Form
- Done: submission list wired to `GET /api/v1/submissions`.
- Done: draft creation wired to `POST /api/v1/submissions`.
- Done: save/update wired to `PATCH /api/v1/submissions/{id}`.
- Done: submit wired to `POST /api/v1/submissions/{id}/submit`.
- Done: delete wired to `DELETE /api/v1/submissions/{id}`.
- Done: guard rail panel wired to `POST /api/v1/submissions/{id}/evaluate-slot`.
- Done: media upload now follows the backend contract: direct Supabase Storage upload, then metadata attach to `POST /api/v1/submissions/{id}/media`.
- Done: backend lookup shape wired for allowed file types, file size, media count, and schedule windows.

### Dashboard
- Done: stat tiles use live endpoints where available: submissions, institutions, and user counts.
- Gap: pending invitation count remains hardcoded `0` until backend exposes a count/list endpoint for pending invitations.

### Pending - Frontend
- Gap: category/tag/preferred-time selection is limited because backend lookups do not currently return those fields.
- Gap: `AssetPickerModal` cannot be fully wired until UC-2.2 media asset list/delete endpoints exist.
- Gap: validator review actions need UC-2.1 backend.
- Gap: notification badge/stream needs UC-2.3 SSE backend.
- Gap: analytics dashboard needs UC-2.4 backend.
- Gap: calendar, publishing, AI caption, and recommendation screens need UC-3.x backend.
- Gap: `GET /api/v1/me` helper exists, but app load should still be cleaned up to hydrate current user from `/me`.

### Frontend Verification
- Done: `npm.cmd run build` passed.
- Required env vars for browser media upload:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
