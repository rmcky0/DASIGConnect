# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**DASIGConnect** is a capstone project (Team `2526-sem2-it332-38`, CIT-U) - a web-based Social Media Content Workflow and Scheduling Management System for the **DOST Academe-Science and Innovation Group (DASIG)** under DOST Region 7.

It replaces ad hoc coordination between DASIG member HEIs with a structured workflow: contributors submit event content, validators review it, administrators approve/schedule it, and the system later publishes to the DASIG Facebook Page.

See `README.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `docs/` for project context, SRS, SDD, and task status.

## Commands

### Backend (`/backend`)

```bash
# Run locally
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Build JAR without tests
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Run all tests
./mvnw test

# Run one test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=SubmissionServiceTest
```

Windows note: `.\mvnw.cmd` currently fails in this PowerShell environment. Direct Maven from `.m2/wrapper/dists` was used successfully for the latest verification.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run preview
```

Vite dev server default: `http://localhost:5173`.

## Architecture

DASIGConnect is a three-tier client-server system:

```text
React SPA (Vercel) -> Spring Boot REST API (Render) -> Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector
                                                     -> Supabase Storage
                                                     -> Facebook Graph API
                                                     -> Anthropic Claude
                                                     -> Voyage AI
```

### Backend - Spring Boot 4 / Java 21

- Entry point: `backend/src/main/java/com/dasigconnect/backend/BackendApplication.java`.
- Config: `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
- Local env loading: `spring-dotenv` reads `backend/.env`.
- REST base path: `/api/v1`.
- Auth: stateless JWT through Spring Security and `JwtAuthenticationFilter`.
- Tenancy: institution scoping through `TenantScopeService` plus PostgreSQL RLS.
- DB migrations: Flyway in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`.
- DB access: Spring Data JPA + Hibernate through HikariCP.
- Critical pool limit: keep Hikari max pool size at 5 for Supabase Session Pooler.

### Frontend - React 19 / TypeScript / Vite

- Entry: `frontend/src/main.tsx`.
- App shell: `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`.
- API clients: `frontend/src/api/`.
- UI: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS v4.
- Routing: React Router v7.
- HTTP: Axios with Authorization header managed by `setAuthToken`.
- Session expiry: `App.tsx` parses JWT `exp`, shows countdown banner near expiry, and opens the session modal at timeout.
- Media upload: browser uploads binary directly to Supabase Storage, then the app sends media metadata to the backend.

## Current Local Status - 2026-05-21

Current branch: `feature/uc13-submission-backend`.

### Completed

- UC-1.3 submission backend is implemented and tested.
- Required tests are present:
  - `SubmissionServiceTest`
  - `SubmissionControllerTest`
  - `UserServiceTest`
  - `UserControllerTest`
- Frontend API wiring now matches backend contracts for submissions, guard rail evaluation, media upload metadata, institutions, and lookups.
- Reset password page is implemented.
- Session expiry countdown is wired from JWT `exp`.
- Dashboard stats use live endpoints where backend support exists.
- `InstitutionController` exposes canonical `/api/v1/institutions` and legacy `/api/v1/admin/institutions`.

### Verification

- Backend: 163 tests passing.
- Frontend: `npm.cmd run build` passing.

### Known Gaps

- Pending invitation count is still hardcoded because no backend pending-invitation count/list endpoint exists.
- Submission lookups do not return categories, tags, or preferred time slots.
- Media library / asset picker needs UC-2.2 backend: `GET/DELETE /api/v1/media-assets`.
- Validator review actions need UC-2.1 backend.
- SSE notifications need UC-2.3 backend.
- Analytics need UC-2.4 backend.
- Calendar, auto-publish, manual fallback, AI captions, and recommendations need UC-3.x backend.
- Client has a `/me` helper, but app boot should still be cleaned up to hydrate current user from `GET /api/v1/me`.
- Browser media upload requires `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Backend runtime still needs real SMTP and Supabase service credentials.

## Domain Model

### User Roles

| Role | Scope | Key Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTRIBUTOR` | Per institution | Submit content and upload media |
| `VALIDATOR` | Per institution | Review institution submissions |
| `ADMINISTRATOR` | Network-wide | Manage institutions, users, approvals, scheduling, analytics |

### Core Entities

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `User` | System user with role and institution binding |
| `Institution` | DASIG member HEI workspace |
| `Submission` | Content submission with event details and status |
| `SlotReservation` | Scheduled slot reservation for a submission |
| `InvitationToken` | One-time onboarding token |
| `PasswordResetToken` | One-time password reset token |
| `AccountLockout` | Failed-login tracking |
| `AuditLog` | Immutable state-changing action log |
| `MediaAsset` | Supabase-backed media metadata; pgvector embedding is not Hibernate-mapped |
| `SubmissionMediaAsset` | Submission-to-media junction with display order |

Important enum values are lowercase in the database, including roles and statuses. Keep Java/database serialization aligned with the existing code.

## Key Design Decisions

- JWT auth is stateless; do not introduce server-side sessions.
- Tenant isolation is enforced in application services and PostgreSQL RLS.
- Flyway owns schema changes. Add migrations instead of relying on Hibernate DDL.
- `BackendApplication` custom Flyway/diagnostic beans are gated by `spring.flyway.enabled`; tests depend on this isolation.
- `MediaAsset.embedding` is not Hibernate-mapped because pgvector `VECTOR(1024)` is handled through native queries.
- Media upload is direct-to-Supabase from the frontend, followed by backend metadata attach. The backend does not receive multipart file bytes for Module 1.
- Do not increase HikariCP max pool size past 5 unless the Supabase plan/pooler changes.
- Do not log JWTs, passwords, reset tokens, invitation tokens, or API keys.
