# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**DASIGConnect** is a capstone project (Team `2526-sem2-it332-38`, CIT-U) - a web-based Social Media Content Workflow and Scheduling Management System for the **DOST Academe-Science and Innovation Group (DASIG)** under DOST Region 7.

It replaces ad hoc coordination between DASIG member HEIs with a structured workflow: contributors submit event content, validators review it, administrators approve/schedule it, and the system later publishes to the DASIG Facebook Page.

See `README.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `docs/` for project context, SRS, SDD, and task status.

## Commands

### Backend (`/backend`)

```bash
# Run locally
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Build JAR without tests
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Run all tests
./mvnw test

# Run one test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=SubmissionServiceTest
```

Windows note: `.\mvnw.cmd` currently fails in this PowerShell environment. Direct Maven from `.m2/wrapper/dists` was used successfully for the latest verification.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run preview
```

Vite dev server default: `http://localhost:5173`.

For local frontend-to-backend calls, create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=dasigconnect-media
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<supabase-anon-key>
```

`frontend/.env.local` is intentionally ignored and should not be committed.

## Architecture

DASIGConnect is a three-tier client-server system:

```text
React SPA (Vercel) -> Spring Boot REST API (Render) -> Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector
                                                     -> Supabase Storage
                                                     -> Facebook Graph API
                                                     -> Anthropic Claude
                                                     -> Voyage AI
```

### Backend - Spring Boot 4 / Java 21

- Entry point: `backend/src/main/java/com/dasigconnect/backend/BackendApplication.java`.
- Config: `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
- Local env loading: `spring-dotenv` reads `backend/.env`.
- REST base path: `/api/v1`.
- Auth: stateless JWT through Spring Security and `JwtAuthenticationFilter`.
- Tenancy: institution scoping through `TenantScopeService` plus PostgreSQL RLS.
- DB migrations: Flyway in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`.
- DB access: Spring Data JPA + Hibernate through HikariCP.
- Critical pool limit: keep Hikari max pool size at 5 for Supabase Session Pooler.

### Frontend - React 19 / TypeScript / Vite

- Entry: `frontend/src/main.tsx`.
- App shell: `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`.
- API clients: `frontend/src/api/`.
- UI: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS v4.
- Routing: React Router v7.
- HTTP: Axios with Authorization header managed by `setAuthToken`.
- Session expiry: `App.tsx` parses JWT `exp`, shows countdown banner near expiry, and opens the session modal at timeout.
- Media upload: browser uploads binary directly to Supabase Storage, then the app sends media metadata to the backend.

## Current Local Status - 2026-05-26

Current branch: `module3`

### Completed

- UC-3.1 publishing pipeline and master calendar backend is fully implemented (19 new files, 3 modified).
- Flyway V12 + V13 migrations add `publication_attempts` and `facebook_page_tokens` tables.
- `TokenEncryptionService` encrypts Facebook Page Access Token with AES-256-GCM before DB storage.
- `FacebookPublisherService` integrates with Facebook Graph API v25.0 via Java HttpClient: 2-step photo publish, single-call video publish, 3-attempt retry with 5s/25s/125s backoff.
- `PublishingSchedulerJob` triggers every minute (GR-T5). Transaction is committed before Graph API calls to respect HikariCP 5-connection limit.
- `StaleSubmissionDetectorJob` handles missed publish windows every 5 minutes (GR-T9).
- `TokenHealthCheckJob` validates the page token daily at 08:00 UTC (GR-T4).
- `CalendarService` + `CalendarController` expose `GET /api/v1/calendar` with role-scoped masking.
- Admin reschedule via `PATCH /api/v1/submissions/{id}/reschedule` supports guard rail overrides with audit trail.
- UC-3.4 Resolution Center: `ManualPublishingService` + `ResolutionController` (`/api/v1/resolution`).
- `AbandonmentDetectorJob` clears manual publish sessions open longer than 2 hours.
- UC-3.1 frontend Calendar route `/scheduler/calendar` is wired to `GET /api/v1/calendar` using FullCalendar, reusable calendar components, status legend, event detail modal, loading/empty/error states, and refresh/retry controls.
- UC-3.4 frontend Resolution Center route `/admin/resolution` is wired to `GET /api/v1/resolution/failures` plus retry and manual-publish start/complete/cancel actions using reusable cards, status/action components, modals, busy states, toasts, and refresh-after-action behavior.
- UC-3.1 frontend API separation is in place: `frontend/src/api/calendarApi.ts` owns calendar calls and `frontend/src/api/resolutionApi.ts` owns Resolution Center calls.
- Submit Content Facebook Preview is now dynamic and componentized. It reads current form/draft caption, schedule, saved assets, and local uploaded files instead of hardcoded preview data.
- Facebook Preview card opens a responsive preview/review modal with a larger Facebook-style preview, submission details, validation/missing-field messaging, and action buttons wired to existing Save Draft / Submit for Review / Edit Details handlers.
- Facebook Preview media now supports carousel review with arrow controls, dots/counter, and swipe gestures in both compact and modal contexts.
- Preview modal includes a draggable media-order strip with keyboard-friendly move buttons. Reordering updates the real submission order: local files upload in the chosen order and saved draft assets persist through `PATCH /api/v1/submissions/{id}/media/order`.
- Backend submission media reorder support added: `SubmissionMediaOrderDto`, `SubmissionController.reorderMedia`, and `SubmissionService.reorderMedia()` update `submission_media_assets.display_order` for editable submissions.
- UC-1.3 submission backend is implemented and tested (on `feature/uc13-submission-backend`, pending merge).
- Frontend API wiring matches backend contracts for submissions, guard rail evaluation, media upload metadata, institutions, and lookups.
- Reset password page implemented. Session expiry countdown wired from JWT `exp`.
- Dashboard stats use live endpoints. Invite/manage modal lists pending invitations and supports resend.
- App auth state hydrates from `GET /api/v1/me` after login, invite accept, session relogin, and saved-token restore.
- **Save draft / submit-for-review browser flow verified end-to-end** — 500 bug fixed (see Flyway and notification fixes below).
- **Live Facebook publish verified** — photo post published to the DASIG Facebook Page from a scheduled submission.

### Flyway Migration History Fix (2026-05-26)

The Supabase DB had a mixed Flyway state: V10 was recorded with checksum 0 (manually baselined), and V6–V9 were local files that were never applied while V10 was already in `flyway_schema_history`. This caused `FlywayValidateException` on startup.

Fix applied:
- V6–V9 migration files removed from the codebase (they were never applied to the DB).
- Their content recreated as V14–V17 (linear versions after V13), so Flyway applies them in clean order.
- V17 (`asset_tags`) was rewritten to `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS asset_tags CASCADE` before recreating — V4 had created `asset_tags` with columns `(asset_id, tag, source)` which do not match the `AssetTag` entity mapping `(media_asset_id, label)`.
- `BackendApplication.flyway()` bean now calls `flyway.repair()` before `flyway.migrate()` to fix stored checksums; no `outOfOrder` or `validateOnMigrate=false` needed.
- Current migration sequence: V1–V5 (applied), V10 (applied), V11–V17 (applied on 2026-05-26 startup).

### Submit 500 Fix (2026-05-26)

`SubmissionService.submit()` called `notificationService.createNotification()` directly inside the main `@Transactional` method. When the `notifications` table didn't exist (missing Flyway migration), the INSERT failed and rolled back the entire transaction — including the PENDING status change — returning 500 to the frontend. Fix: wrapped the T1 notification block in try-catch so the submission always reaches PENDING even if the notification insert fails. The notifications table is now created by V14 and this guard is no longer needed for normal operation, but is retained as a defensive measure.

### GlobalExceptionHandler Fix (2026-05-26)

`SlotAlreadyTakenException` was not handled by `GlobalExceptionHandler` and fell through to the catch-all, returning 500 instead of 409 Conflict. Added explicit handler returning 409 with the exception message.

### Verification

- Backend: **208 tests passing** (0 failures, 0 errors) — all 163 prior tests pass plus UC-3.1 additions.
- Frontend: `npm.cmd run build` passing.
- UC-3.1 frontend: `npm.cmd run build` passed after Calendar and Resolution Center implementation.
- UC-3.1 frontend: targeted ESLint passed for `src/features/calendar`, `src/features/resolution`, `src/hooks/useCalendarEvents.ts`, `src/hooks/useResolutionFailures.ts`, `src/api/calendarApi.ts`, and `src/api/resolutionApi.ts`.
- Submit Content / Facebook Preview: `npm.cmd run build` passed after dynamic preview, preview modal, carousel, and media reorder implementation.
- Submit Content / Facebook Preview: targeted ESLint passed for `src/features/submission/SubmissionScreen.tsx`, `src/components/facebook`, `src/hooks/useFacebookPreviewData.ts`, `src/hooks/useMediaReorder.ts`, and `src/types/facebook.ts`.
- Submission media reorder backend: `.\mvnw.cmd "-Dtest=SubmissionServiceTest,SubmissionControllerTest" test` passed with 29 focused tests after adding the reorder service test.
- Full-project `npm.cmd run lint` still fails due pre-existing lint debt in older files outside the UC-3.1 frontend slice.
- Vite dev server started locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5176/` because ports 5173-5175 were occupied.
- Migration sanity: `mvn clean` and `mvn spring-boot:run` applied V11–V17 successfully on existing Supabase DB.
- Submit-for-review flow: confirmed working end-to-end in the browser.
- Facebook publish: confirmed — photo post published to DasigConnect Facebook Page.

### Known Gaps

- UC-3.1 frontend browser action testing still needs an authenticated admin session and active backend to manually exercise retry, manual publish start, complete, and cancel against live data.
- Submission queue design needs review with real data and mobile widths.
- Submission lookups do not return categories, tags, or preferred time slots.
- Media library / asset picker needs UC-2.2 backend: `GET/DELETE /api/v1/media-assets`.
- Validator review actions need UC-2.1 backend.
- SSE notifications need UC-2.3 backend.
- Analytics need UC-2.4 backend.
- AI captions (UC-3.2) and AI classification/recommendation (UC-3.3) not started.
- No built-in validator account exists. Use the administrator dashboard to invite validators.
- Backend deployment runtime still needs team-owned SMTP and Supabase service credentials.

## Key Design Decisions

- JWT auth is stateless; do not introduce server-side sessions.
- Tenant isolation is enforced in application services and PostgreSQL RLS.
- Flyway owns schema changes. Add migrations instead of relying on Hibernate DDL.
- Do not edit generated files under `backend/target`; fix migration conflicts in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration`.
- `BackendApplication` custom Flyway/diagnostic beans are gated by `spring.flyway.enabled`; tests depend on this isolation.
- `MediaAsset.embedding` is not Hibernate-mapped because pgvector `VECTOR(1024)` is handled through native queries.
- Media upload is direct-to-Supabase from the frontend, followed by backend metadata attach. The backend does not receive multipart file bytes for Module 1.
- Submission media ordering is controlled by `submission_media_assets.display_order`; publishing queries already load assets ordered by this field. Use `PATCH /api/v1/submissions/{id}/media/order` for saved draft media reorder instead of mutating media asset records.
- Fresh Supabase `public` schemas should baseline Flyway at version `0`, not `1`; otherwise V1 is skipped and Module 1 tables are never created.
- Invitation links are treated as superseded when a fresh invite/resend is issued for the same email; do not leave multiple open invite links for one pending account.
- The frontend should display institution names from `GET /api/v1/me`; email-domain guessing is only a fallback.
- Do not increase HikariCP max pool size past 5 unless the Supabase plan/pooler changes.
- Do not log JWTs, passwords, reset tokens, invitation tokens, or API keys.
- `BackendApplication.flyway()` calls `repair()` then `migrate()` explicitly. Do not add `outOfOrder=true` or `validateOnMigrate=false` — fix schema history issues by renumbering migration files instead.
- When a migration file was never applied to a shared DB but a higher-version migration already was, do not reuse the old version number. Create new files at the next available version number.
- V4 creates `asset_tags` with columns `(asset_id, tag, source)`. V17 drops and recreates it with `(media_asset_id, label)` to match the `AssetTag` entity. Do not revert V17.
- Notification inserts in `SubmissionService.submit()` (T1 — notify validators) are wrapped in try-catch. This is intentional: a notification failure must never roll back the PENDING status transition.
